# Personal Financial Management System

This was my capstone project for my [Computer Programming and Analysis A.S.](https://www.hccfl.edu/academics/subjects/information-technology/computer-programming-and-analysis).

This is a program that helps a person manually keep track of their personal finances encrypted and saved locally on their computer.

This program is compiled with Java 8 for a Windows 10 computer.

To run the program:

1. Download and unzip the `ProgrammingCapstoneApp` folder.
2. Open to the contents of the `ProgrammingCapstoneApp` folder.
3. double-click the `ProgrammingCapstoneApp.exe` file.
